## Motivation
The excellent [bitcoin_flutter](https://github.com/anicdh/bitcoin_flutter) library didn't support BIP38, which is needed for @ArkEcosystem's crypto implementations.

## Contributing
This library is in its infancy, it would be very nice to see contributions from expert Dart programmers in terms of optimization and review.

## Package
The Dart package for this library can be found on [pub](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/bip38); though it is still untested and won't work for the moment.
